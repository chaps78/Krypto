# Krypto
#####################################
Python trader BOT hosted by Docker

#####################################

Using the principe that the market is always oscilating, I use a bot who buy and sell wiht small difference of price and get benefice on this small difference of price.

I use the "noise" of the signal to generate benefice.

The difference between a buy and a sell is not fix and can be parametrise with the value of the current price of your crypto

#####################################

If the price increase a lot, my bot will sell a lot of the currency (or buy if the price go down).

For this problem, the value I buy or I sell is parametrised by the curent price of the currency.

#####################################

The benefice I make auto increase the amont of the bet in the small range closs to the current price

#####################################

I am initialy using Kraken for my system but I am working to swith to Binance because the fee are lower, and the amout of the fee are realy important.
